    <h2>What It Is</h2>
    <p>The Interview Simulator is a web application where you can practice job interviews in a safe, repeatable way. You choose a role (e.g., Software Engineer), optionally a company, and a difficulty level, then run through technical, behavioral, or design interviews. Questions are generated by an AI model, and after each answer you receive a score and written feedback. Your sessions are saved so you can track progress over time in a dashboard.</p>

    <h2>Why You Would Want to Use It</h2>
    <p>If you are preparing for real interviews, you get a space to rehearse without scheduling with another person. You can target the type of interview (technical, behavioral, or design) and tune difficulty and programming language (for technical interviews). The AI gives you immediate feedback and a score, and after several sessions the dashboard highlights strengths and areas for improvement so you can focus your practice.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>You start by creating an account or logging in. From the interview screen you enter the role you’re practicing for and optionally the company, then pick difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and, for technical interviews, a programming language. You choose one of three interview types: Technical, Behavioral, or Design.</p>
    <p>Once you start, the system generates a question tailored to your choices. You type (or use voice input where available) your answer and submit it. The AI evaluates your answer and returns a score and detailed feedback. In behavioral and design flows you may get follow-up questions for a more conversational experience. You can add session notes for yourself. When you’re done with a question, you move to the next one or end the interview.</p>
    <p>Your completed sessions are stored and summarized on the Dashboard: recent and average scores by interview type, and after enough sessions, strengths and areas for improvement derived from your feedback, plus a history of past interviews so you can review what you did and how you were scored.</p>
