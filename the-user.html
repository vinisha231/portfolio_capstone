    <h2>What It Is</h2>
    <p>When you use this platform, you get a web application built for practicing job interviews in a safe, repeatable way. You choose a role (e.g., Software Engineer), optionally a company, and a difficulty level, then run through technical, behavioral, or design interviews. Questions are generated for you by an AI model, and after each answer you receive a score and written feedback. Your sessions are saved so you can track your progress over time in a dashboard.</p>

    <h2>Why You Would Want to Use It</h2>
    <p>If you are preparing for real interviews, the simulator gives you a space to rehearse without scheduling with another person. You can target the type of interview you need—technical, behavioral, or design—and tune difficulty and programming language for technical practice. The AI gives you immediate feedback and a score; after several sessions your dashboard highlights your strengths and areas for improvement so you can focus your practice effectively.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>You create an account or log in. From the interview screen you enter the role you are practicing for and optionally the company, then pick difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and, for technical interviews, a programming language. You choose one of three interview types: Technical, Behavioral, or Design.</p>
    <p>Once you start, the system generates a question tailored to your choices. You type (or use voice input where available) your answer and submit it. The AI evaluates your answer and returns a score and detailed feedback. In behavioral and design flows, follow-up questions give you a more conversational experience. You can add session notes. When you finish a question, you move to the next one or end the interview.</p>
    <p>Your completed sessions are stored and summarized on your Dashboard: recent and average scores by interview type, and after enough sessions, strengths and areas for improvement from your feedback, plus a history of past interviews for review.</p>
