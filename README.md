# Interview Simulator – Capstone Portfolio

A portfolio site showcasing the **Interview Simulator** capstone project. It is a **separate repository** from the main capstone codebase.

Live site: https://vinisha231.github.io/portfolio_capstone/index.html

## Pages

1. **Landing (Home)** – Entry point with links to all other pages.
2. **The User** – Stakeholder perspective: what it is, why you would want to use it, how it works (2nd person).
3. **Capstone Experience** – Themes, artifacts, pivots, and narratives on how the project was built and evolved.
4. **Annotated Bibliography** – Resources by theme with annotations (MLA or APA).
5. **Overall Capstone** – Reflective narrative (5–7 themes, 3–4 paragraphs each, plus conclusion/next steps).

## Design

Proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast in `css/style.css`. High-contrast colors, semantic headings, and consistent navigation across pages.
