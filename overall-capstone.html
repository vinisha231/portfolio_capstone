    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Change the theme subheadings below later to match your own narrative (replace the generic titles with themes that fit your experience).</p>
    <p>This page is a reflective narrative of the overall capstone experience: why you chose the project, how you approached it, what worked, what was hard, what you learned about yourself, and what you would do differently. Use 5–7 themes as subheadings, each with about 3–4 paragraphs. End with a <strong>Conclusion</strong> or <strong>Next Steps</strong> section. The bullets in the instructions (motivation, challenges, stakeholders, etc.) are for brainstorming; organize your narrative into coherent themes, not a list of bullets.</p>

    <h2>Theme 1: Choosing the Project and Goals</h2>
    <p><em>Reflect on why you picked the Interview Simulator, how it connects to your interests or career goals, and what you wanted to achieve. A few paragraphs that set the stage and show applied learning from earlier coursework.</em></p>

    <h2>Theme 2: Approach and Process</h2>
    <p><em>Describe how you approached the work: planning, methodology, scheduling, and how you stayed focused. You can reference status reports, milestones, or tools you used. This shows how you think and organize work.</em></p>

    <h2>Theme 3: Learning by Doing</h2>
    <p><em>Discuss what you had to learn on your own—new APIs, frameworks, or concepts—and how you found and used resources. Give concrete examples. This demonstrates that you can learn independently.</em></p>

    <h2>Theme 4: Working with Others and Feedback</h2>
    <p><em>If you had stakeholders, users, or an instructor: what was it like finding and working with them? What feedback did you get and how did it change your work? If solo, reflect on how you sought or used feedback from documentation, peers, or grading comments.</em></p>

    <h2>Theme 5: Successes and What Worked</h2>
    <p><em>What are you proud of? What technical or process decisions paid off? Be specific so a reader can see the results of your effort.</em></p>

    <h2>Theme 6: Challenges and What You Would Do Differently</h2>
    <p><em>What was difficult, confusing, or disappointing? How did you work through it? If you could go back, what would you do differently (e.g., more time on testing, earlier deployment, different scope)? Honest reflection shows maturity.</em></p>

    <h2>Conclusion / Next Steps</h2>
    <p><em>Summarize what the capstone means to you and what you plan to do next: continue the project, deploy it, add features, or take the experience into future work or job applications.</em></p>
